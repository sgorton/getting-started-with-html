<h1>HTML </h1>

<p><b>HTML</b> HTML documents are what the majority of the Web's content and they can contain <b><em>text</em></b> which describes "what you see"
  and <em><b>markup</b></em> which describes "how it looks".
</p>

<b>Tags, Elements and Attributes</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>
  Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to My Code Pen I just need to write: 
<a href="http://codepen.io/sgorton/">Steve's Pen</a>
 </p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
